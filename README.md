### Section 1: Who am I?
- My name is Mark, I'm 24 years old and I'm a junior Front-End Developer. 
- I'm familiarized with CSS/HTML/JavaScript/Jquery in VSC program. 
- I'm have ended official courses in ITStudy.ee school. 
- Likewise, I want to improve my new skills, learn new things and develop in IT direction.

 ### Section 2: Why I chose this way?
 - Whole my life, I'm using computer, playing video-games, watching series/films on different platforms, also YouTube, and while I'm on site, I am always asking myself how they created this website and how it is working.
Of course, these thoughts haunted, and I got a dream, that in one day, in one moment I'll start learning and getting to know with big world of IT industry. Someone said it's already late, but it's never too late to learn something new.
 
 ### Section 3: My next steps?
 - After last day of studying, I took a rest and exhaled, thinking about next steps.
And came to this understanding:
1. - Keep practice
2. - Learning how I can do freelance, because I never even used any freelance resources.
3. - Finding some internship
